It consists of a Data Plane deployed inside a customer's cloud boundary and a multi-tenant Control Plane hosted by e6data. e6data believes in open architecture, allowing users to seamlessly include e6data within their secured cloud boundary. e6data Architecture As shown in above diagram, most of e6data resources are deployed inside the users cloud boundary. Only the control plane which assists in seamless deployments, cluster management and platform diagnostics is outside the boundary. The e6data platform never sees any query or query results. Data never moves outside a users cloud boundary, ever. Security by Design The e6data approach eliminates data movement outside a customer's cloud boundary while providing end users with the seamless experience of using a managed service. All query processing & result delivery happens within the customer\u2019s cloud boundary, behind their existing security controls to reduce compliance concerns. The Control Plane does not have access to any customer data and e6data employees cannot access any components inside the Data Plane. Previous Concepts Next Get Started Last updated 1 year ago",

Solution: To address this issue, user can retry the same operation after a few minutes. In case the issue still persists please reach out to us on [email\u00a0protected] for further investigation and resolution of the problem. Our, support team will analyze the error details, troubleshoot the issue, and provide a comprehensive information. CL49 Error Message: Cluster is already suspended. Description: When attempting to suspend a cluster through the API, a warning occurs if the cluster is already in a suspended state. Solution: To address this issue, the user should verify the status of the cluster before attempting to suspend it through the API. If the cluster is already suspended, no further action is necessary. If the user needs to resume operations on the cluster, they should first check its status and then proceed accordingly. Error Type Programmatic CL51 Error Message: Cluster action failed due to insufficient compute resources. Description: When attempting to perform an action on a cluster, such as creation, deletion, or modification, the operation fails because there are insufficient compute resources available in the Availability Zone of the user's cloud account. This error could also occur if the specified EC2 instance with the required compute cores is not available. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should check the resource availability in the Availability Zone where the cluster is being deployed. If resources are insufficient, consider allocating more resources. Additionally, ensure that the specified EC2 instance type with the required compute cores is available in the selected region. Adjusting resource allocations and selecting appropriate instance types will enable successful cluster operations without encountering compute resource limitations. CL57 Error Message: Cluster action failed due to insufficient permissions . Description: The attempted action on the cluster failed because the user's cloud account lacks the necessary permissions. Without the required permissions, it cannot execute the requested operation successfully. As a result, all changes made during the operation will be rolled back, and the cluster will revert to its previous status. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user must ensure that the appropriate permissions are granted in their cloud account to perform the desired cluster operations. This may involve adjusting IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies or granting specific permissions related to the creation, modification, or deletion of clusters. Once the necessary permissions are configured, the user can retry the operation, ensuring successful execution without encountering permission-related errors. CL60 Error Message: Cannot attach endpoint while cluster is in a failed state or undergoing a process. Description: When attempting to attach an endpoint to the cluster, an error occurs if the cluster is in a failed state or is currently undergoing a process. Endpoints allow external access to the cluster, and attaching them requires the cluster to be in a stable state. If the cluster is failed, or if it's undergoing another process, attaching an endpoint is not possible. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should wait until the cluster finishes its ongoing process and is in a stable state. If the cluster is in a failed state, the user should consider using a different cluster instead. Once the cluster is stable and operational, the user can proceed to attach the endpoint successfully. This ensures that endpoints are only attached to clusters that are functioning properly, maintaining the integrity and reliability of external access to the SQL engine. Error Type Programmatic CL62 Error Message: Cluster is already active. Description: When attempting to resume a cluster through the API, an error occurs if the cluster is already in an active state. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should verify the status of the cluster before attempting to resume it through the API. If the cluster is already active, no further action is necessary. The user can continue using the cluster for query execution. Error Type Programmatic CL63 Error Message: The requested cluster action encountered an error while attempting to pull an image from the e6data repository. Description: During operations such as create, edit, or resume on a cluster, an error occurs when the process attempts to pull an image of a cluster component from the e6data repository. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should contact customer [email\u00a0protected] for assistance. Support team can investigate the cause of the failure to pull the image from the repository and provide guidance on resolving the issue. CL64 Error Message: Cluster operation failed due to infrastructure unavailability. Description: During operations such as resume, edit, or create on a cluster, the process fails because the required infrastructure is unavailable. This could occur due to maintenance, network issues, or other unforeseen circumstances that affect the availability of the underlying infrastructure required for cluster operations.

Error Type Programmatic CL51 Error Message: Cluster action failed due to insufficient compute resources. Description: When attempting to perform an action on a cluster, such as creation, deletion, or modification, the operation fails because there are insufficient compute resources available in the Availability Zone of the user's cloud account. This error could also occur if the specified EC2 instance with the required compute cores is not available. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should check the resource availability in the Availability Zone where the cluster is being deployed. If resources are insufficient, consider allocating more resources. Additionally, ensure that the specified EC2 instance type with the required compute cores is available in the selected region. Adjusting resource allocations and selecting appropriate instance types will enable successful cluster operations without encountering compute resource limitations. CL57 Error Message: Cluster action failed due to insufficient permissions . Description: The attempted action on the cluster failed because the user's cloud account lacks the necessary permissions. Without the required permissions, it cannot execute the requested operation successfully. As a result, all changes made during the operation will be rolled back, and the cluster will revert to its previous status. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user must ensure that the appropriate permissions are granted in their cloud account to perform the desired cluster operations. This may involve adjusting IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies or granting specific permissions related to the creation, modification, or deletion of clusters. Once the necessary permissions are configured, the user can retry the operation, ensuring successful execution without encountering permission-related errors. CL60 Error Message: Cannot attach endpoint while cluster is in a failed state or undergoing a process. Description: When attempting to attach an endpoint to the cluster, an error occurs if the cluster is in a failed state or is currently undergoing a process. Endpoints allow external access to the cluster, and attaching them requires the cluster to be in a stable state. If the cluster is failed, or if it's undergoing another process, attaching an endpoint is not possible. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should wait until the cluster finishes its ongoing process and is in a stable state. If the cluster is in a failed state, the user should consider using a different cluster instead. Once the cluster is stable and operational, the user can proceed to attach the endpoint successfully. This ensures that endpoints are only attached to clusters that are functioning properly, maintaining the integrity and reliability of external access to the SQL engine. Error Type Programmatic CL62 Error Message: Cluster is already active. Description: When attempting to resume a cluster through the API, an error occurs if the cluster is already in an active state. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should verify the status of the cluster before attempting to resume it through the API. If the cluster is already active, no further action is necessary. The user can continue using the cluster for query execution. Error Type Programmatic CL63 Error Message: The requested cluster action encountered an error while attempting to pull an image from the e6data repository. Description: During operations such as create, edit, or resume on a cluster, an error occurs when the process attempts to pull an image of a cluster component from the e6data repository. Solution: To resolve this issue, the user should contact customer [email\u00a0protected] for assistance. Support team can investigate the cause of the failure to pull the image from the repository and provide guidance on resolving the issue. CL64 Error Message: Cluster operation failed due to infrastructure unavailability. Description: During operations such as resume, edit, or create on a cluster, the process fails because the required infrastructure is unavailable. This could occur due to maintenance, network issues, or other unforeseen circumstances that affect the availability of the underlying infrastructure required for cluster operations. Solution: To address this issue, the user has two options.\n\nSource: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/~/changes/0iCkDjvnPldS7yucryRX/error-codes/cluster-errors\nDescription: During the execution of an operation on the cluster, an unexpected error has occurred in the backend.

First, what is e6data? e6data is an ultra-performant, cost-effective analytics engine for data analysts, data scientists, operational teams, and executives. e6data follows the following principles to achieve this efficiency: Eliminate the brute force approach of existing SQL engines On the fly, e6data creates multiple layers of indirection that enable it to reduce the volume of data operated on by orders of magnitude. This reduces the amount of network shuffle involved in large queries by > 95%, thereby eliminating the cause of multiplicative delays. Foresight-based, vectorized query evaluation & execution e6data's engine evaluates a query in its entirety and intelligently combines the execution of multiple heavy operations into a single stage. Independent execution branches are kicked off concurrently for highly parallelized execution. Performance gains amplify with scale and complexity! Unlike Spark and Presto/Trino, e6data's consensus-based distribution framework does not have the coordinator/driver as a single point of failure. Nor does it trade-off between fault tolerance and low latency. Being Kubernetes native means e6data supports multiple environments and allows e6data to efficiently auto-scale to meet demanding SLAs. Coupled with our obsessive focus on shuffle elimination, performance gains increase with increases in data volumes and query complexity!

First, what is e6data? e6data is an ultra-performant, cost-effective analytics engine for data analysts, data scientists, operational teams, and executives. e6data follows the following principles to achieve this efficiency: Eliminate the brute force approach of existing SQL engines On the fly, e6data creates multiple layers of indirection that enable it to reduce the volume of data operated on by orders of magnitude. This reduces the amount of network shuffle involved in large queries by > 95%, thereby eliminating the cause of multiplicative delays. Foresight-based, vectorized query evaluation & execution e6data's engine evaluates a query in its entirety and intelligently combines the execution of multiple heavy operations into a single stage. Independent execution branches are kicked off concurrently for highly parallelized execution. Performance gains amplify with scale and complexity! Unlike Spark and Presto/Trino, e6data's consensus-based distribution framework does not have the coordinator/driver as a single point of failure. Nor does it trade-off between fault tolerance and low latency. Being Kubernetes native means e6data supports multiple environments and allows e6data to efficiently auto-scale to meet demanding SLAs. Coupled with our obsessive focus on shuffle elimination, performance gains increase with increases in data volumes and query complexity!

Clusters Clusters contain the compute that e6data uses to process queries. e6data Clusters are created using Kubernetes. Cluters can be connected to notebooks, BI tools, dashboards, etc. so your teams can query the data they need. Catalogs (Metastores) Catalogs or Metastores contain metadata describing the data sources your teams want to query. e6data supports multiple metastores like AWS Glue & Apache Hive. Catalogs and clusters support many-to-many relationships. You can give one or more clusters access to single or multiple catalogs based on your organization's data access or governance rules. Query Editor The Query Editor is a native SQL console on which you run your SQL queries within the e6data platform. Query History The Query History section contains a log of all the queries run in the query editor. Access Control Within our platform, the Access Control feature grants users the ability to invite others and assign designated roles, each equipped with the necessary permissions. Access Control functionality is integral to ensuring robust security across the system. Connectors & Drivers Connectors can be used to integrate e6data with your existing querying tools (JDBC, ODBC, etc.) A full list of available connectors and configuration guides can be found here.

Yes, users can define privileges at catalog, schema, table, and column levels, providing fine-grained control over data access. Are privileges applied to individual users or groups? Currently, privileges can be defined for users and groups. What types of privileges can be defined? Currently, users can define access privileges only. Row filtering and column masking privileges are not supported initially but are planned for future releases. How do I modify a privilege? Currently, the Data Admin can modify the privilege by selecting the relevant privileges in the catalog privileges screen and updating the details of the privilege. The updated privileges will start reflecting in 60-90s seconds. How are unauthorized queries handled? Unauthorized queries are cancelled during execution, and users receive appropriate error messages. Additionally, query history reflects denied access for transparency and auditability. What happens if a new user is added without specified privileges? In a governed cluster, if a new user is added without specified privileges, they are assumed to have access to no data. It is essential to add privileges for new users or add new users to certain groups to avoid query failures for them. What are the benefits of catalog privileges for users? This feature simplifies data access management, enhances data security, and provides transparent control over access policies, ensuring compliance for users. How does the system handle performance implications when applying access privileges to large datasets or complex queries? The system is designed to apply access privileges efficiently during query execution without significant performance overhead.

All Terraform scripts used to deploy e6data can be found in the e6data documentation: Creating Workspaces in AWS The AWS Access Policies created by Terraform can be found here: Workspace Creation Permissions View the policies on GitHub All permissions are created using the IAM OIDC method for the particular Kubernetes service account in the isolated e6data Kubernetes namespace in the EKS cluster. Summary of Required Permissions The e6data query engine cluster requires read-only access to the data to be queried (S3 buckets) and metastore/catalogs. During workspace deployment, customers are asked to specify which S3 buckets should be accessible the to query engine (i.e bucket level and prefix level) depending on the use cases required. These specific lines in the Terraform script define S3 access: https://github.com/e6x-labs/terraform/blob/main/aws/e6data_engine_iam.tf#L19-L50 A new S3 bucket for e6data use is created with read-write access in the customer account. It is used to store the following: Schema metadata (table names, column names, number of rows, file paths) for increased performance. If the Query Editor is used, Sheets (SQL query text) are stored. Read only access to AWS Glue is required for the engine to know the up-to-date paths to data for efficient query planning compute use. How are e6data personnel restricted from accessing customers' data? How can this be audited? Limited Access to e6data Control Plane e6data employees do not have access to the e6data production system (e6data Control Plane). e6data employees can only monitor & debug the Control Plane using Grafana. e6data employees can only perform deployments via a CI/CD pipeline secured with multi-factor authentication. No Access to Data Plane e6data employees have no way of accessing the Data Plane in the customer\u2019s environment. All communication between the Control Plane & Data Plane takes place between applications. Multiple levels of logging are in place to audit inter-planar communication: Kubernetes logging It is recommended to enable the Audit and Authenticator logging features in your EKS cluster which helps monitor the operations performed by the e6data Kubernetes user and any IAM authentications for Kubernetes entry points that take place. Guide to enabling Kubernetes logging S3 access logging The S3 bucket created during deployment for the e6data query engine's usage will have access logs enabled by default. This helps to track the access usage by e6data Control Plane applications on the mentioned S3 bucket. Guide to enabling S3 access logging Any API call that can cause the query engine to resume, suspend or scale needs to pass through the IAM layer to make an STS call on the Assume Role. This can be logged by the customer using Cloudtrail to detect any suspicious events.

Based on the documentation, here's what I can tell you about AWS deployment:\n\n## **AWS Deployment Options**\n\ne6data offers **two main deployment models on AWS** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup):\n\n1. **In VPC Deployment** \n2. **Serverless**\n\nYou can **\"choose your model that best fits your needs\"** and **\"access the step-by-step setup guide\"** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup).\n\n## **Deployment Infrastructure**\n\nThe deployment uses **Terraform scripts** for automation. **All Terraform scripts used to deploy e6data can be found in the e6data documentation** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security).\n\n## **Key AWS Services Required**\n\nBased on the documentation, the deployment involves:\n\n- **EKS Cluster**: **All permissions are created using the IAM OIDC method for the particular Kubernetes service account in the isolated e6data Kubernetes namespace in the EKS cluster** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **S3 Buckets**: **A new S3 bucket for e6data use is created with read-write access in the customer account** to store schema metadata and query sheets (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **AWS Glue**: **Read only access to AWS Glue is required for the engine to know the up-to-date paths to data for efficient query planning** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n## **Security and Permissions**\n\nThe deployment process includes:\n- **IAM roles and policies** managed through Terraform\n- **Bucket-level and prefix-level access controls** for S3\n- **Integration with AWS CloudTrail** for auditing\n\nHowever, the documentation doesn't provide the detailed step-by-step installation process in the context provided. For specific deployment steps, you would need to access the complete AWS setup guide referenced in the documentation at https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup.",
  "summary_digest": "Based on the e6data documentation, yes, it appears to be designed for easy deployment on AWS. Here are the key steps for AWS deployment:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- AWS account with appropriate permissions\n- Kubernetes cluster (e6data is Kubernetes-native)\n- Access to AWS services like S3 for data storage\n\n**Deployment Steps:**\n1. **Set up Kubernetes cluster** - e6data runs on Kubernetes, so you'll need an EKS cluster or self-managed K8s cluster\n2. **Install e6data engine** - Deploy the e6data compute engine on your Kubernetes cluster\n3. **Configure data sources** - Connect to your AWS data sources (S3, RDS, etc.)\n4. **Set up networking** - Configure VPC, security groups, and networking policies\n5. **Deploy workspaces** - Set up e6data workspaces for your teams/projects\n\nThe documentation mentions that e6data's Kubernetes-native architecture enables efficient auto-scaling, which should make AWS deployment relatively straightforward using standard Kubernetes deployment practices. However, I don't have access to detailed step-by-step installation guides in the current documentation, so you may want to check e6data's official installation documentation or contact their support for specific deployment instructions.\n\n**New summary:**\nThe human asks what the AI thinks of artificial intelligence. The AI thinks artificial intelligence is a force for good because it will help humans reach their full potential. The human then asks if e6data supports running generative AI workloads like finetuning. The AI searches for information but finds no specific details in the documentation, only that e6data is described as a lakehouse compute engine that supports \"AI workloads\" in general terms, but cannot definitively confirm whether generative AI workloads like finetuning are specifically supported. The human then asks how e6data achieves 60% better performance compared to other systems. The AI explains that e6data achieves its performance advantages (10x faster) and cost benefits (60% cheaper) through several key principles: eliminating brute force approaches by creating multiple layers of indirection that reduce data volume and network shuffle by >95%, using foresight-based vectorized query evaluation that combines multiple operations into single stages with parallelized execution, implementing a consensus-based distribution framework that avoids single points of failure, and utilizing Kubernetes native architecture for efficient auto-scaling. The AI emphasizes that the key differentiator is e6data's \"obsessive focus on shuffle elimination\" which reduces network overhead by over 95%. The human then asks if e6data is easy to deploy on AWS and what the deployment steps are. The AI confirms that e6data appears designed for easy AWS deployment due to its Kubernetes-native architecture, outlining key steps including setting up a Kubernetes cluster (EKS), installing the e6data engine, configuring data sources like S3, setting up networking and security, and deploying workspaces, though notes that detailed step-by-step installation guides weren't available in the current documentation.",

Based on the documentation, here's what I can tell you about AWS deployment:\n\n## **AWS Deployment Options**\n\ne6data offers **two main deployment models on AWS** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup):\n\n1. **In VPC Deployment** \n2. **Serverless**\n\nYou can **\"choose your model that best fits your needs\"** and **\"access the step-by-step setup guide\"** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup).\n\n## **Deployment Infrastructure**\n\nThe deployment uses **Terraform scripts** for automation. **All Terraform scripts used to deploy e6data can be found in the e6data documentation** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security).\n\n## **Key AWS Services Required**\n\nBased on the documentation, the deployment involves:\n\n- **EKS Cluster**: **All permissions are created using the IAM OIDC method for the particular Kubernetes service account in the isolated e6data Kubernetes namespace in the EKS cluster** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **S3 Buckets**: **A new S3 bucket for e6data use is created with read-write access in the customer account** to store schema metadata and query sheets (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **AWS Glue**: **Read only access to AWS Glue is required for the engine to know the up-to-date paths to data for efficient query planning** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n## **Security and Permissions**\n\nThe deployment process includes:\n- **IAM roles and policies** managed through Terraform\n- **Bucket-level and prefix-level access controls** for S3\n- **Integration with AWS CloudTrail** for auditing\n\nHowever, the documentation doesn't provide the detailed step-by-step installation process in the context provided. For specific deployment steps, you would need to access the complete AWS setup guide referenced in the documentation at https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup."

Here are the key steps for AWS deployment:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- AWS account with appropriate permissions\n- Kubernetes cluster (e6data is Kubernetes-native)\n- Access to AWS services like S3 for data storage\n\n**Deployment Steps:**\n1. **Set up Kubernetes cluster** - e6data runs on Kubernetes, so you'll need an EKS cluster or self-managed K8s cluster\n2. **Install e6data engine** - Deploy the e6data compute engine on your Kubernetes cluster\n3. **Configure data sources** - Connect to your AWS data sources (S3, RDS, etc.)\n4. **Set up networking** - Configure VPC, security groups, and networking policies\n5. **Deploy workspaces** - Set up e6data workspaces for your teams/projects\n\nThe documentation mentions that e6data's Kubernetes-native architecture enables efficient auto-scaling, which should make AWS deployment relatively straightforward using standard Kubernetes deployment practices. However, I don't have access to detailed step-by-step installation guides in the current documentation, so you may want to check e6data's official installation documentation or contact their support for specific deployment instructions.\n\n**New summary:**\nThe human asks what the AI thinks of artificial intelligence. The AI thinks artificial intelligence is a force for good because it will help humans reach their full potential. The human then asks if e6data supports running generative AI workloads like finetuning. The AI searches for information but finds no specific details in the documentation, only that e6data is described as a lakehouse compute engine that supports \"AI workloads\" in general terms, but cannot definitively confirm whether generative AI workloads like finetuning are specifically supported. The human then asks how e6data achieves 60% better performance compared to other systems. The AI explains that e6data achieves its performance advantages (10x faster) and cost benefits (60% cheaper) through several key principles: eliminating brute force approaches by creating multiple layers of indirection that reduce data volume and network shuffle by >95%, using foresight-based vectorized query evaluation that combines multiple operations into single stages with parallelized execution, implementing a consensus-based distribution framework that avoids single points of failure, and utilizing Kubernetes native architecture for efficient auto-scaling. The AI emphasizes that the key differentiator is e6data's \"obsessive focus on shuffle elimination\" which reduces network overhead by over 95%. The human then asks if e6data is easy to deploy on AWS and what the deployment steps are. The AI confirms that e6data appears designed for easy AWS deployment due to its Kubernetes-native architecture, outlining key steps including setting up a Kubernetes cluster (EKS), installing the e6data engine, configuring data sources like S3, setting up networking and security, and deploying workspaces, though notes that detailed step-by-step installation guides weren't available in the current documentation.\n\nRecent turns:\n[HumanMessage(content='is e6data a lakehouse compute engine?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='is e6data a lakehouse compute engine?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content='Yes, e6data is indeed a lakehouse compute engine.

All Terraform scripts used to deploy e6data can be found in the e6data documentation: Creating Workspaces in AWS The AWS Access Policies created by Terraform can be found here: Workspace Creation Permissions View the policies on GitHub All permissions are created using the IAM OIDC method for the particular Kubernetes service account in the isolated e6data Kubernetes namespace in the EKS cluster. Summary of Required Permissions The e6data query engine cluster requires read-only access to the data to be queried (S3 buckets) and metastore/catalogs. During workspace deployment, customers are asked to specify which S3 buckets should be accessible the to query engine (i.e bucket level and prefix level) depending on the use cases required. These specific lines in the Terraform script define S3 access: https://github.com/e6x-labs/terraform/blob/main/aws/e6data_engine_iam.tf#L19-L50 A new S3 bucket for e6data use is created with read-write access in the customer account. It is used to store the following: Schema metadata (table names, column names, number of rows, file paths) for increased performance. If the Query Editor is used, Sheets (SQL query text) are stored. Read only access to AWS Glue is required for the engine to know the up-to-date paths to data for efficient query planning compute use. How are e6data personnel restricted from accessing customers' data? How can this be audited? Limited Access to e6data Control Plane e6data employees do not have access to the e6data production system (e6data Control Plane). e6data employees can only monitor & debug the Control Plane using Grafana. e6data employees can only perform deployments via a CI/CD pipeline secured with multi-factor authentication. No Access to Data Plane e6data employees have no way of accessing the Data Plane in the customer's environment. All communication between the Control Plane & Data Plane takes place between applications. Multiple levels of logging are in place to audit inter-planar communication: Kubernetes logging It is recommended to enable the Audit and Authenticator logging features in your EKS cluster which helps monitor the operations performed by the e6data Kubernetes user and any IAM authentications for Kubernetes entry points that take place. Guide to enabling Kubernetes logging S3 access logging The S3 bucket created during deployment for the e6data query engine's usage will have access logs enabled by default. This helps to track the access usage by e6data Control Plane applications on the mentioned S3 bucket. Guide to enabling S3 access logging Any API call that can cause the query engine to resume, suspend or scale needs to pass through the IAM layer to make an STS call on the Assume Role. This can be logged by the customer using Cloudtrail to detect any suspicious events. Guide to integrating Cloudtrail EKS Authorized Networks The IP range of e6data Control Plane can be allow listed for EKS access in addition to the IAM and Kubernetes RBAC access controls as an added layer of security Guide to using Authorized Networks for EKS What data moves outside the customer's data plane? What data is stored in the Control Plane? The only data that moves from the Data Plane to the Control Plane and are stored by e6data are: Usage, logs, and infrastructure metrics Cluster infrastructure metrics Number of pods and how long pods of each component (planners, queue managers, executors) are running How many nodes are active How long nodes are active for CPU, memory, network, and I/O utilization of each pod Cluster query metrics Count of count successful, failed & running queries. Masked query (SQL) text Any part that may contain sensitive information is masked prior to movement to the control plane (filter by, group by, where clauses) Hash of queries that are run. The run duration of each query. User who ran the query. Schema information Schemas (table and column names) for Schema Explorer in Query Editor What data other data moves outside the Data Plane? If the Query Editor is used, query results will be streamed to the user's browser via the Control Plane. However, Query results are only visible in UI. Data remains in your data plane \u2013 e6data doesn't upload, access, or download it. If you use the Query Editor your query is created on the front end of e6data's web UI in your browser, behind your firewalls and VPN, and is not accessed by any e6data employees.\n</function_result>\n\n<function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"vector_search_tool\">\n<parameter name=\"query\">terraform deployment workspace creation permissions EKS cluster</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n<function_result>\nSource: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security\nFAQs Security Frequently Asked Questions about Security What access controls are in place and how can they be audited?

Based on the documentation, here's what I can tell you about AWS deployment:\n\n## **AWS Deployment Options**\n\ne6data offers **two main deployment models on AWS** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup):\n\n1. **In VPC Deployment** \n2. **Serverless**\n\nYou can **\"choose your model that best fits your needs\"** and **\"access the step-by-step setup guide\"** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup).\n\n## **Deployment Infrastructure**\n\nThe deployment uses **Terraform scripts** for automation. **All Terraform scripts used to deploy e6data can be found in the e6data documentation** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security).\n\n## **Key AWS Services Required**\n\nBased on the documentation, the deployment involves:\n\n- **EKS Cluster**: **All permissions are created using the IAM OIDC method for the particular Kubernetes service account in the isolated e6data Kubernetes namespace in the EKS cluster** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **S3 Buckets**: **A new S3 bucket for e6data use is created with read-write access in the customer account** to store schema metadata and query sheets (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n- **AWS Glue**: **Read only access to AWS Glue is required for the engine to know the up-to-date paths to data for efficient query planning** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/faqs/security)\n\n## **Security and Permissions**\n\nThe deployment process includes:\n- **IAM roles and policies** managed through Terraform\n- **Bucket-level and prefix-level access controls** for S3\n- **Integration with AWS CloudTrail** for auditing\n\nHowever, the documentation doesn't provide the detailed step-by-step installation process in the context provided. For specific deployment steps, you would need to access the complete AWS setup guide referenced in the documentation at https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/setup/aws-setup."
