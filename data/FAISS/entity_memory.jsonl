{"conversation_id": "conversation_id_20250710_110935", "user_input": "can I deploy e6data without kubernetes?", "agent_response": "Yes, you can definitely deploy e6data on AWS! \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, e6data features **multi-cloud support** and works across different cloud providers including AWS, Azure, and GCP. This means you can deploy and run e6data on your AWS infrastructure.\n\n## **Benefits of deploying e6data on AWS:**\n\n- **Native AWS Integration**: Seamlessly connects with AWS data services like S3, RDS, Redshift, and other AWS data sources\n- **AWS Infrastructure**: Leverages AWS's robust compute, storage, and networking capabilities\n- **Cost Optimization**: Takes advantage of AWS's pricing models and e6data's efficient resource utilization\n- **Security**: Benefits from AWS's security features and compliance standards\n- **Scalability**: Utilizes AWS's auto-scaling capabilities combined with e6data's serverless architecture\n\n## **Getting Started:**\nTo deploy e6data on AWS, you would typically:\n1. Contact the e6data team for deployment guidance\n2. Set up the necessary AWS resources and permissions\n3. Configure e6data to work with your existing AWS data infrastructure\n4. Connect your preferred BI tools and start querying\n\nThe serverless, cloud-native architecture of e6data makes it well-suited for AWS environments, allowing you to focus on analytics rather than infrastructure management.", "entities": {}}

This reduces the amount of network shuffle involved in large queries by > 95%, thereby eliminating the cause of multiplicative delays** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/introduction-to-e6data).\n\n## **Foresight-Based, Vectorized Query Evaluation & Execution**\n**e6data's engine evaluates a query in its entirety and intelligently combines the execution of multiple heavy operations into a single stage. Independent execution branches are kicked off concurrently for highly parallelized execution** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/introduction-to-e6data).\n\n## **Consensus-Based Distribution Framework**\n**Unlike Spark and Presto/Trino, e6data's consensus-based distribution framework does not have the coordinator/driver as a single point of failure. Nor does it trade-off between fault tolerance and low latency** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/introduction-to-e6data).\n\n## **Kubernetes Native Architecture**\n**Being Kubernetes native means e6data supports multiple environments and allows e6data to efficiently auto-scale to meet demanding SLAs. Coupled with our obsessive focus on shuffle elimination, performance gains increase with increases in data volumes and query complexity** (Source: https://docs.e6data.com/product-documentation/introduction-to-e6data).\n\nThe key differentiator is e6data's **\"obsessive focus on shuffle elimination\"** which reduces network overhead by over 95%, leading to both better performance and lower costs.", "entities": {}}
