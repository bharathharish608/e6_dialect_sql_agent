      "content": "You're absolutely right! That's an excellent point. Using reserved words like `year` and `month` as column aliases can cause issues in many SQL engines, including e6data. Let me provide revised queries that avoid reserved words as aliases:\n\n## **Revised Query Options**\n\n### **Option 1: Using EXTRACT function (avoiding reserved words)**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS order_year,\n    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate) AS order_month,\n    CASE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate)\n        WHEN 1 THEN 'January'\n        WHEN 2 THEN 'February'\n        WHEN 3 THEN 'March'\n        WHEN 4 THEN 'April'\n        WHEN 5 THEN 'May'\n        WHEN 6 THEN 'June'\n        WHEN 7 THEN 'July'\n        WHEN 8 THEN 'August'\n        WHEN 9 THEN 'September'\n        WHEN 10 THEN 'October'\n        WHEN 11 THEN 'November'\n        WHEN 12 THEN 'December'\n    END AS month_name,\n    SUM(o_totalprice) AS total_order_amount,\n    COUNT(*) AS order_count\nFROM orders \nWHERE o_orderdate >= CAST('1995-01-01' AS DATE)   \n    AND o_orderdate < CAST('1997-01-01' AS DATE) \nGROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate)\nORDER BY order_year ASC, order_month ASC;\n```\n\n### **Option 2: Using DATE_PART function (avoiding reserved words)**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    DATE_PART('year', o_orderdate) AS order_year,\n    DATE_PART('month', o_orderdate) AS order_month,\n    SUM(o_totalprice) AS total_order_amount,\n    COUNT(*) AS order_count\nFROM orders \nWHERE o_orderdate >= CAST('1995-01-01' AS DATE)   \n    AND o_orderdate < CAST('1997-01-01' AS DATE) \nGROUP BY DATE_PART('year', o_orderdate), DATE_PART('month', o_orderdate)\nORDER BY order_year ASC, order_month ASC;\n```\n\n### **Option 3: Using quoted identifiers (if e6data supports them)**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate) AS \"order_year\",\n    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate) AS \"order_month\",\n    SUM(o_totalprice) AS \"total_order_amount\",\n    COUNT(*) AS \"order_count\"\nFROM orders \nWHERE o_orderdate >= CAST('1995-01-01' AS DATE)   \n    AND o_orderdate < CAST('1997-01-01' AS DATE) \nGROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o_orderdate), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o_orderdate)\nORDER BY \"order_year\" ASC, \"order_month\" ASC;\n```\n\n## **Key Changes Made:**\n- Changed `year` alias to `order_year`\n- Changed `month` alias to `order_month`\n- Used non-reserved words for all aliases\n- Maintained the same logic and functionality\n\n## **Best Practices for e6data:**\n1. **Avoid reserved words** as column aliases\n2. **Use descriptive, non-reserved aliases** like `order_year`, `sales_month`, etc.\n3. **Test with simpler queries first** to understand e6data's date function support\n4. **Consider using quoted identifiers** if supported by e6data\n\nThanks for catching that potential issue! This approach should be much more compatible with e6data's SQL parser."
